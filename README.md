# Infinite Parkour Datapack Updater
An updater for the Infinite Parkour Datapack.
# Install Instructions 
Windows only. *sorry macOS you are somewhat a work in progress, need a macOS user to help*

Download the installer and run it. The app will be installed in your documents folder

Might be flagged by Anti-virus software, but you can check the code here. It is safe to run and use.

you will need to have 
[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads
) installed, but the app can install it for you

If you use the normal .minecraft folder, you don't need to do anything.

If you use a different location, put the path to the folder in the 'custom path' box. It will remember your settings.  (note. not the world folder, the Minecraft folder)

If you have any problems press the DEBUG button and send the contents of the log file to me [here](https://discord.com/users/1327055692179177494)

# Then run it to update to the latest version
